### Project: NetworkUS

NetworkUS is a desktop app for organizing contacts. It features seamless **group management**, allowing for **quick searches of contacts with desired traits** (i.e specialization) and hence **project group formation**. It is catered for **Computer Science Students** with fields such as Github and Linkedin. The app is optimized for the **Command Line Interface (CLI)** to allow swift access for keyboard users. The app is also complemented with **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** to display the program.
